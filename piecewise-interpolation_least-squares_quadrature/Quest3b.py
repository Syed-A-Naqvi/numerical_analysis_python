# Question 3b from Assignment 5
# Composite trapezoidal rule for different number of subintervals

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from CompTrapA5 import CompTrap

#  define function f(x) to be integrated



# define and initialize variables



#  compute trapezoidal approximation for all number of subintervals 
#    (i.e. loop through all number of subintervals)  




#  plot your results

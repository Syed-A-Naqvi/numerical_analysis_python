\section{Equations}
This is a demonstration of some of the latex commands that you need for the assignment.
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = x_n^{2\frac{1}{2}} \sin{x} \cos{x} \log{x}
\end{equation}
To write the math expression in-line (i.e. in the text),
you have to put a \$ at each side of the symbol.
So if we want to represent the function f(x) in-line,
we should write it with \$ on either side: $f(x)$
